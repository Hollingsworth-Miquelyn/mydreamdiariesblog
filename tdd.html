		            <h3>Synopsis</h3>
		            <p>Rorie Fletcher has to decide whether or not to trust the pirates. These
		            are not the speedboat pirates she has heard of back home on the news,
		            but cannon-firing, cutlass-wearing, big-bearded pirates.</p>
		            <p>At home she would have done anything to be normal, to rid herself of the
		            years of haunting dreams she chronicles in her diaries. But when she is
		            whisked away by an unknown force to the land of her dreams and promised
		            that the dreams will stop if she delivers her diaries, her fear of fitting
		            in is replaced by old west gunfights, wagon hijacks and prison breaks.
		            Rorie is joined by a group of assorted companions, who each have their
		            own reasons to follow, fight, and rebel.</p>
		            <p>The controlling government is massing to deliver a devastating blow,
	                and the unknown force is anything but trustworthy.  This brings Rorie
	                to her current dilemma. Should she run and put her life and the lives
		            of her trusted companions in the hands of blood thirsty pirates or stay and
		            make a stand against the overwhelming power of the government?</p>

		            <dl>
		                <dt>Rorie Fletcher</dt>
		                <dd>She is a smart, confident girl who has no confidence in her
		                intelligence or her ability. She believes that if the dreams she has
		                been having for the last three years would stop then she could fit
		                in at school. She is about to be forced to learn who she really is
		                and what she can really do.</dd>
		                <dt>Saidi</dt>
		                <dd>She is a strong willed yet understand natural leader. She believes
		                in Rorie more than Rorie believes in herself. She is undeterred in her
		                believe of the importance of their mission and will be the driving
		                force until Rorie learns to believe in herself.</dd>
		                <dt>Boyd</dt>
		                <dd>He is a quiet doting loner. He is the son of a Regent, born to rule
		                his people. Boyd is more capable than anyone gives him credit for. Although
		                he may not come out and say what is on his mind, it is clear to anyone watching
		                where his motivation stems from and what his motives truly are.</dd>
		                <dt>Uncle</dt>
		                <dd>He is a literal giant of a man. He is Boyd's true uncle. Uncle is the name he
		                goes by when visiting home. Uncle is at first the guide and body guard that helps
		                our travelers find their way in the world, but ultimately becomes a true believer
		                in Rorie's potential.</dd>
