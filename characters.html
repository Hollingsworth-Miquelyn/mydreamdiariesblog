						<h3>Grower Characters</h3>
		            <p>The list below contains a description of the main characters of the Grower episodes.</p>
		            <dl>
		                <dt>Carise</dt>
		                <dd>She is headstrong. She will say anything that she perceives
		                as truthful. She is disliked by the majority of her peers because
		                she is perceived as an insufferable know-it-all. She fights often
		                with her younger brother, but will fiercely come to his aid.</dd>
		                <dt>Geoff</dt>
		                <dd>He is the younger brother of Carise. He is friendly, a risk taker,
		                and liked by everyone but he as only a few close friends. He is often
		                frustrated with his older sister but feels that she is unduly mistreated
		                and excluded by the other kids.</dd>
		                <dt>Dawn</dt>
		                <dd>She is a pretty girl who feels that she isn't very smart. She
		                idolizes Carise and believes she is the source of all information.
		                She would do anything to impress Carise.</dd>
		                <dt>Jerek</dt>
		                <dd>He is Geoff's best friend. He does his best to mirror the antics
		                and charisma of his best friend. He is jealous at the ease at which Geoff
		                endears himself to everyone in the community.</dd>
		            </dl>
							<h3>Pirate Characters</h3>

								 in a raid wen he was just a child. He was raised in his grandfather's
								 household and enjoyed all the benefits of his grandfather's station.</dd>
								 <dt>Drea</dt>
								 <dd>She is the granddaughter of the local pirate leader and cousin
								 to Sil. She lives in a separate house but is as close to Sil as a sister.
								 She is confident and quick witted. She is happy to let Sil lead, although,
								 it's clear that she is the natural leader.</dd>
								 <dt>Furio</dt>
								 <dd>He was born in to a family with no distinction. He is accepted in to
								 Sil's inner circle because of his strength and fearlessness. He is
								 constantly fearful of rejection because of his social standing. He
								 will do anything to keep Sil's approval.</dd>
								 <dt>Lehy</dt>

								 is beautiful and unabashed. She has every citizen either enamored or
								 jealous.</dd>
